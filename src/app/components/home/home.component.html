        <u> End Goal</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The goal for this economy is to raise capital to create a P2E game where
        BINU NFTs will serve as avatars in the game.<br />
        With this capital we plan to invest in upcoming technologies in
        metaverse lands such as NFT Worlds, The Sandbox, etc...<br />
        This is not limited to vitural assets but also to real world assets such
        as investing in properties and businesses where capital will be
        reinvested into the projects and returned as dividends to holders.<br />
        $BINU will be needed to enter our metaverse and play the game. Where
        BINU NFT holders will represent a fraction of game ownerhsip.

        <u> Initial Coin Offering</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        The ICO will be in tiered systems with price starting lower and
        increasing as time goes on untill we are sold out.

        <u> Staking $BINU</u>
      </h5>
      <p>
        Once the ICO is over the only way to continue to purchase $BINU will be
        on a DEX or by staking. <br />
        Currently staking is set to %5.09 a year. (Which is equivalent to %5 a
        year compounded quarterly.)<br />
        This is based of a year being 31,536,000 seconds not including leap
        years.

      <P>
        Once released you will be able to purchase BINU NFTs with $BINU at a
        discounted price or at a higher tiered price using BNB.<br />
        Staking a BINU NFT will reward you 24 BINU a day for 10 years.</P

        A snapshot will be taken and additional $BINU will be created and
        airdropped to holders.<br />
        We plan on airdopping out benefits to our holders along with giveaways
